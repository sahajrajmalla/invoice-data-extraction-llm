Prompt: Extract Key Information from OCR Data of Invoices Using Google Cloud Vision API

Objective: Process OCR data extracted from an invoice image to identify and format key details into a structured JSON format. Focus on extracting 'invoice_number', 'issue_date', 'table' and 'total', along with their corresponding 'bbox' (bounding box coordinates, representing the top-left and bottom-right corners of the text on the image).

Data Source: The OCR data provided contains text elements and their bounding box coordinates, extracted using Google Cloud Vision API.

Required Fields for Extraction:
  - invoice_number: The unique identifier of the invoice, along with invoice_number_bbox.
  - issue_date: The date when the invoice was issued, along with issue_date_bbox.
  - table: The table of items and their corresponding quantities and prices, along with table_bbox.
  - total: The total amount of the invoice, along with total_bbox.

Example Input:
text, [bbox]
INVOICE, [52, 48, 232, 100] 
US, [654, 214, 670, 223] 
-, [670, 214, 674, 223] 
001, [675, 214, 694, 223] 
11/02/2019, [634, 238, 694, 250] 
$, [627, 563, 636, 579] 
154.06, [637, 563, 683, 579]
...

[Note: There will be many such text elements and their corresponding bbox coordinates in the input data. Please try to identify the relevant ones and extract the required fields.]

Task: Analyze the provided OCR data and extract the relevant information in the specified JSON structure. Ensure accurate identification of 'invoice_number', 'issue_date', 'table' and 'total', with a focus on both text accuracy and bbox precision.

Evaluation Criteria:
   - Key-Value (KV) Extraction: A correct KV extraction requires a fuzzy match > 80% with the ground truth text and a bbox Intersection over Union (IoU) > 80% for each of the three KV fields.
   - Table Extraction: A valid table extraction requires a fuzzy match > 80% with the ground truth table text and a bbox IoU > 80%.
   - Scoring: Extraction score for each document is calculated as follows: If KV = 1 and Table = 1, the score is 1; if KV = 0 and Table = 1, the score is 0.5. The final score is the mean of scores across all documents.

Handling Ambiguities: In cases of unclear data or missing fields, make the field None.

Output Format: Please return only the JSON output as per the specified structure. Don't include any other information in the output. [This is very strict]
